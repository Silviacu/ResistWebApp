                We support the advocacy and resistance movements that reflect our 
                multiple and intersecting identities. We call on all defenders of 
                human rights to join us. Protest is the first step towards unifying
                our communities, grounded in new relationships, to create change from 
                the grassroots level up. We work peacefully while
                recognizing there is no true peace without justice and equity for all.
            </p>

                The rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, 
                and threatened many of us - immigrants of all statuses, Muslims 
                and those of diverse religious faiths, people who identify as LGBTQIA,
                Native people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, 
                survivors of sexual assault - and our communities are hurting and 
                scared. We are confronted with the question of how to move forward 
                in the face of national and international concern and fear.

                In the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human 
                rights, dignity, and justice who have come before us, we join 
                in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore.
                The Womenâ€™s March on Washington will send a bold message to our
                new government on their first day in office, and to the world that
                women's rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing
                that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.
